                <p><strong><p>About me:<br/></strong> Hi, my name is Jesse Sean Abarca. I was born on April 8th, 2003 at Dameron Hospital in Stockton, California. My family consists of my mother father, sister and brother, I am the youngest out of three siblings. I have recently just graduated from Edison High School and I am a bearer the <em>Seal of Biliteracy</em> for proficiency in Spanish, the <em>Golden State Seal Merit Diploma</em> for displaying mastery of the curriculum in at least six subjects, and bearer of the <em>California Scholarship Federation Seal</em> for taking honors and AP classes. I have also received a sash for completion of the <em>Project Lead The Way</em> engineering pathway in which I dedicated three years of taking specific classes which included: introduction to engineering design, engineering principles, and computer integrated manufacturing. Furthermore, I am OSHA certified as of 05/04/2020. Moreover, I have committed <a href="./pdfs/Hours Verification - Jesse Abarca.pdf" target="_blank">90 service hours</a> to volunteering in an organization called <em>Changiest</em> in which my group organized a mutual aid where we provided individuals with funds of up to $50 so they can purchase their necessities during the midst of the pandemic. Furthermore, as of this moment, I am currently 18 years old and attending CodeStack Academy as of 11/1/21. Inevitably, I am excited to attend this academy and I am looking forward to learning and to growing as developers with all of you!</p>

                <p><strong>Video Games:</strong> My favorite video game series is the <em>Halo</em> series. My favorite game of the series is <em>Halo 3 ODST</em> for its amazing soundtrack and overall feeling of loneliness that it emits, I recommend playing this game on a rainy day!</p>
                <p><strong>Baseball:</strong> I played little league baseball growing up for about 3 years. I played third baseman, shortstop, left field, and right field. My favorite baseball team is the <em>San Francisco Giants</em>.</p>
                <p><strong>Anime:</strong> I love watching anime during my spare time and my favorite anime is <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, the English dub is amazing.</p>
